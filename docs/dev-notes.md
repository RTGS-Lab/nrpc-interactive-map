# Dev Notes — NRPC Interactive Map

## Stack
Pure static site. No build step, no package manager. Deployed via GitHub Pages from `master`.

| Dependency | Source |
|---|---|
| ArcGIS JS API 4.29 | CDN (AMD/Dojo loader) |
| JSZip 3.10.1 | CDN |

**Important:** JSZip must load **before** the ArcGIS script tag in `index.html`. Loading it after causes a Dojo AMD `multipleDefine` conflict that breaks city layer queries.

## File Structure

```
index.html          — app shell, script loading order
styles.css          — all custom styles
js/
  shp-writer.js     — binary SHP/SHX/DBF/PRJ encoder (pure JS, no ArcGIS)
  export-utils.js   — GeoJSON builder, safeName() (pure JS, no ArcGIS)
  main.js           — all ArcGIS/UI logic (~700 lines)
docs/
  hub_site_text.html — embeddable content for ArcGIS Hub site (6-tab CSS interface)
  NRPC-use-cases.md  — source document for use case narratives
  dev-notes.md       — this file
```

`shp-writer.js` and `export-utils.js` expose globals consumed by `main.js`. All three load in the `<body>` after ArcGIS.

## Map Data
All layers, symbology, and default visibility are managed in **ArcGIS Online**.
Portal item ID: `d664f1d163544d25bb92921e5c4bf214`

The map must be publicly shared — there is no auth in the app.

## main.js Structure

| Section | What it does |
|---|---|
| `queryAllFeatures()` | Paginates feature queries in batches of 1,000 via OID-first strategy |
| `getExportableLayers()` | Walks visible layers, skips Boundaries group and graphics layers |
| `view.when()` | Everything below runs after the map loads |
| Toggle bar | Builds the top-left button bar (Legend, Layers, Basemap, Zoom to..., Clip & Zip) |
| LayerList setup | Opacity sliders on all layers/groups; group click expands and turns on all children |
| City/county dropdown | Multi-select cities or full county; highlights extent on map; feeds clip geometry |
| Clip & Zip | Queries, encodes, and packages visible non-Boundaries layers to SHP or GeoJSON ZIP |
| Basemap dropdown | Switches between Light Gray Canvas, Imagery, Navigation; per-basemap opacity slider |
| Legend auto-show | Legend starts hidden; auto-opens the first time any non-Boundaries group is turned on |
| Layer visibility watchers | Keep Clip & Zip panel state (warning vs. ready) in sync as layers are toggled |

## Notable Constraints / Known Issues

- **Large layer exports:** The "Parcel Prioritization Model Results" polygon layer can freeze the browser if exported alongside several other layers simultaneously. Root cause is cumulative ZIP memory. Feature arrays are nulled after encoding to give GC a hint, but no hard limit is enforced.
- **No error UI:** If the WebMap fails to load (e.g. portal item permissions), there is no user-facing error message.
- **Basemap IDs:** Only use verified ArcGIS basemap string IDs. `"osm"` was removed — it returns "Access Blocked" in this context. Valid options in use: `"satellite"`, `"streets-navigation-vector"`.
